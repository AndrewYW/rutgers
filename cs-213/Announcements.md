##### Welcome to CS 213

>Hi all,

>Welcome to CS 213, aka Software Methodology. Hope you had a refreshing summer break, and are raring to go!

>There will be NO RECITATIONS this week (Thursday, Sep 8). Recitations will start next week (first recitation will be on Thursday, Sep 15).

>Some things to know about what's going on with SPNs/section change requests:

>There is a HUGE demand to get into this course. Until last year, it was only taught in the Spring semester, but starting this year, we are offering it in the fall. So all of you registered for this class are the lucky beneficiaries of this positive development.

>Still, there are literally hundreds of SPN requests in the queue. So, we have stretched the capacity of the class even more to accommodate a greater number of students than ever before - well over 200 in a single lecture!

>We have given out a lot of SPNs numbers in the past few days. Many students have been emailing me about their request. If you didn't get an email with an SPN, that means your name wasn't high enough in the queue. There may be hope still for some students in the queue, IF students who were given SPNs don't need them anymore, or there are students who drop. I will track this through this week and act accordingly. (And seniors will get dibs again if and when spots open up.) You may want to pass on this message to your friends who may be waiting to get in.

>For those of you who have asked for section changes: since this requires a drop and a new SPN, I am NOT going to be able to entertain your request since that would be at the expense of students in the SPN queue who are waiting to get into the class.

>I am looking forward to an engaging semester! See you all in class on Wednesday.

>-- Sesh Venugopal

#### USACS Mentoring program

>Hi all,

>The following message is on behalf of USACS.

>Sesh V

>-----

>USACS, the general undergraduate CS organization, is continuing its mentorship
program this year. Our mentees will have the opportunity to learn practical
skills used in the tech industry that might not obtained from the theory-driven
curriculum. Our mentors are proficient in topics ranging from web development
to machine learning, interview skills to system administration, and more.
Mentors will have the chance to build upon teaching skills while fostering
the growth of fellow computer science students. This is also a great way to get
involved with the Rutgers tech community at large! If any of these things
interest you, feel free to sign up as a mentor or mentee under the Mentorship
tab at http://usacs.rutgers.edu/. We will be hosting a number of mentorship
interest meetings at the beginning of the fall semester to foster connections
and encourage pairings - more info is available on our website.
