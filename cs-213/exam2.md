>Here are the list of topics that will be covered: inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, polymorphism, UML.
This includes everything we have done in lectures (up to and including Default Methods in Interfaces of Nov 2) and recitation (up to and including Nov 3, Interface Default Methods/OO Design) EXCEPT GUI material. Serialization and design patterns will NOT be on the exam. Lambda expressions will NOT be on the exam either.

>Unlike the first exam, which emphasized specific Java features, the focus on this second exam will be on OO design and implementation, plus UML. So pay attention to lecture and recitation material that specifically address these topics such as when to use inheritance and when not to, how to use interfaces/abstract classes, what are the different ways in which polymorphism can be implemented, etc.

>Also pay attention to particular aspects of UML such as data that is a consequence of associations that don't get included in either of the classes at either end of the association because they are not inherent to the individual classes, association classes and how they come about, uni and bidirectional associations, etc. The recitation problems in UML address these aspects pretty thoroughly.
