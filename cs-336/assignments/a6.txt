For each of the following schedules, state whether it is conflict-serializable. If yes, provide all equivalent serial schedules. If no, state why it is not conflict-serializable. (ri(X) denotes a read on object X for transaction Ti. wj(Y) denotes a write on object Y for transaction Tj.)
r1(X), r3(Y), r2(Y), w3(Y), r3(X), r2(Z), w1(X), w2(Z), r1(Z), w1(Z)
r1(X), r2(Y), r3(Y), w3(Y), r2(Z), w1(X), r3(X), r1(Z), w2(Z), w1(Z)
r1(X), w1(X), r3(Y), r1(Z), w3(Y), r2(Y), r2(Z), r3(X), w1(Z), w2(Z)

1. Not serializable: r2(y) and w3(y) conflict
2. Not serializable: w2(z) and r1(z) conflict
3. Not serializable: r2(z) and w1(z) conflict

Let T1, T2, T3 be the following transactions:

T1: r1(D), w1(B), w1(D)
T2: r2(C), w2(B)
T3: r3(D), w3(D), w3(B)ã€€
For each of the following schedules, state whether it is possible under 2PL protocol? Give your reasons.
r1(D), r2(C), w2(B), w1(B), r3(D), w3(D), w1(D), w3(B)
r3(D), r1(D), w1(B), w3(D), r2(C), w2(B), w1(D), w3(B),
r2(C), r1(D), w2(B), r3(D),w3(D), w3(B), w1(B), w1(D)
r1(D), r2(C), w2(B), r3(D), w1(B), w3(D),w3(B), w1(D)

1. Not possible
2. Not possible
3. Not possible
4. Not possible

  Let us begin with two bars: Cabana and Old Tavern. Cabana has local patrons A and remote patrons B, while Old Tavern has local patrons C and remote patrons D. Now a new bar New Tavern is opened in this area.  Then Cabana and Old Tavern  begin to lose clients. Suppose we have the followings two transactions:
T1: Cabana loses all patrons to Old Tavern. First locals, than the rest
T2: Old Tavern loses all patrons to New Tavern, first locals than the rest

Given the following schedule:
T2: Insert local patrons of Old Tavern into New Tavern
T1: Insert local patrons of Cabana into Old Tavern
T2: Delete local patrons of Old Tavern
T1: Delete local patrons of Cabana
T2: Insert remote patrons of Old Tavern into New Tavern
T2: Delete remote patrons of Old Tavern
T1: Insert remote patrons of Cabana into Old Tavern
T1: Delete remote patrons of Cabana

What patrons will each bar have after the execution of this schedule (in terms of A, B, C, D or empty)? Is the schedule serializable (result equivalent to a serial schedule)?\

Cabana:
Old Tavern: A, B
New Tavern: C, D
Serializable: yes
