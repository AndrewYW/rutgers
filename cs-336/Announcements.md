##### No recitations this week
>Welcome to largest ever class of 336! There will not be recitations this week, we will start >next week.
>
>see you all tomorrow!

## Sept. 8, 2016
##### We are all set (almost)

>I have posted syllabus/course descripton, plus I will always have core slides for the week posted, these slides are background to what I will cover in class which is usually more detail, discussion etc. I do not believe in power points :-) They provide good template, but stuff is happening on the white board a lot.  For first two weeks we will talk about SQL.query languages
>etc. We will also post instructions how to set up mysql query workbench and sample database that you can practice queries and also do your homeowrks which are coming soon.

>By the way the "invisible" section 5 which has been added, will soon (I am told) show up there if it has not yet. It is on WED 8:55AM-9:50 AM in SEC 207. As I said in class both Busch and Livingston lectures are the same and all the material is the same, true also for recitations.

## Sept. 9, 2016
#### First weekly assignment posted

>This is a "warm up". Please make sure to install SQL query workbench (per instructions posted also on sakai resources).

## Sept. 13, 2016
#### sql slides correction

>As several of you pointed out (thanks!),  slide 48 query had some serious parenthesis problem. I have (hopefully) corrected it now - replaced the slides on sakai.
BTW, there are many other ways to do this query of course.

## Sept. 13, 2016
#### Good SQL/MySQL sources + TAs

>This referenece below from W3C is  by far the most clear exposition of basic SQL (it is the standard so mysql may not support some keywords, like MINUS for example), but like the example driven exposition.

>http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp

>This one, is mysql tutorial.  Organized  in similar fashion - you can look at different operations on the left panel.

>http://www.tutorialspoint.com/mysql/

>HW queries are mostly  3-liners (no nested subqueries0, i.e. pure Select -From -Where
with possible exception of  the query about exclusive or, we have to use NOT EXISTS, with nested subquery.

>ALSO:  We have 4 TAs whose office hours and emails are listed on sakai.  Since we have almost 300 students (!), I am doinmg my best replying - to assure good response time, please cc
TA of your section, so we both have a chance to see your question and provide you quickly with answer.

## Sept. 13, 2016
#### How to recognize tough sql query from an easy one?

>Will talk tomorrow about it. Notes are posted on sakai - but lots to talk about, so see you in class!

## Sept. 13, 2016
#### Local database for you to try sql queries on different instances

>Good idea to have local database system on your machine so you have full control over the database instances and can try your queries  to test (if indeed they do what they are supposed to).

>Unfortuntely the final test db  instance cannot be changed by you,  for obvious reasons,

>So install also a local db just for yourself.

>Here is recommendation for HeidiSQL which I use also on my machine.: http://www.heidisql.com/download.php, which has a portable version, no extra installation is needed.

>You will need to make your tables using command CREATE, or making csv files and uploading them as tables. But this way you can be totally in charge of the database.

>Still for final submission you need to give us the results on AWS database instance.

## Sept. 14, 2016
#### Request to Livingston class section

>When you are late (and I understand bus delays etc), please use back door to the classroom - door next to me is very disruptive when I already started the class. Thanks!

>Please let me know if I need to get a microphone, i.e. do you hear me OK at the back (just email me).

## Sept. 14, 2016
#### Additional AWS accounts with database instance for Homework

>We have  two more aws accounts with the BarBeerDrinker database.  This should solve the connection problem.. If one does not connect, try another.

>Here are the hostnames and port names

>hostname: cs336-1.c7stfahdfipp.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
Port: 3306

>hostname: cs336-2.crujdr9emkb3.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
Port: 3306

>hostname: cs336-3.cxfcbcuwwrzo.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com
Port: 3306

>The student accounts for all the three db instances are the same

## Sept. 15, 2016
#### Additional aws mysql instances

>Hello everyone,

>We have created two more instances for the purposes of your first homework in case you continue encountering connection problems.
Here are the hostnames and ports of the new instances:

>hostname: cs336.cd76gie44suv.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
port:3306

>hostname: cs336.cciclpil2ydu.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
port:3306

#### Weekly message

>A couple of things

>1. Project: Notice that you should let us know your project groups in 9 days  (since it is just list of names - make your submission just sakai note). Make sure you respond on sakai not in email to me.   FAQ:  Can I form a group with students from another section (even different lecture section)?   YES

>2.  Homework: Notice we have second homework out on Nonmonotone queries. These are to be evaluated on new database instance just added by Qiong and Valia. The one which was used for the first homework is not sufficent since most answers  to the new queries just posted are empty on that first db instance

>3.  Material: For Busch lecture (Hill 116)  print or download the Nonmonotonic queries NOTES which I posted in week 2 lectures forlder.   We will spend half of this Monday class on it.   Plus we will discuss project. The " Group by" slides  will also be useful for Wed class for BOTH Busch and Livingtone classes - plus I will also add some notes on aggregate queries (Group by. COUNT etc).  The firday lecture for Livingston section  (and Monday, Sep 26 for Busch sections) will be on database design (ER) as per syllabus.

## Sept. 19, 2016
#### register clickers

>There is a small group which still have not registered their clickers (we have more than 90% registered already).
We will need them this week on Friday in Livingston for short clicker quiz and for next Monday Busch

>If you have problems please contact one of our graders
Devanesh Agrawal
da506@scarletmail.rutgers.edu

>BTW I notice that RU Listing has several used clickers for sale if you do not have one (we have basic i clicker, iclicker 1 or iclicker 2, just one for menu selection, no text submission capability needed)

>BUT DO NOT ASK ME  ask Devanesh, we did 100% clicker power quizzes last semester for 100 level class....so it should not be any problem here.
