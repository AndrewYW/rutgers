1. Who is your audience. If your project was a live web site - who would be your visitors and what would be the value your web site brings?
The audience is anyone curious in relationships between election results in NJ counties in the past 3 elections, as well as possible trends for 2016 and 2020. Although NJ as a whole has voted Democrat since the 90's,
results between counties are different, and may have ties to age group, gender and income levels.
Our site provides information that may allow for discovery of links between those factors.
2. Would your users return again and how often? Would they share the url with their friends and why?
The most likely return users would be the ones who do not know what type of statistic/data they are looking for. The information we have is not particularly applicable for constant usage (as elections are
once every 4 years)
Additionally, it would most likely be applicable for projects and reports instead of a pure interest in the statistics covered.
