##### We are all set (almost)

>I have posted syllabus/course descripton, plus I will always have core slides for the week posted, these slides are background to what I will cover in class which is usually more detail, discussion etc. I do not believe in power points :-) They provide good template, but stuff is happening on the white board a lot.  For first two weeks we will talk about SQL.query languages
>etc. We will also post instructions how to set up mysql query workbench and sample database that you can practice queries and also do your homeowrks which are coming soon.

>By the way the "invisible" section 5 which has been added, will soon (I am told) show up there if it has not yet. It is on WED 8:55AM-9:50 AM in SEC 207. As I said in class both Busch and Livingston lectures are the same and all the material is the same, true also for recitations.
