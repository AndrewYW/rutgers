##### Welcome to CS 213

>Hi all,

>Welcome to CS 213, aka Software Methodology. Hope you had a refreshing summer break, and are raring to go!

>There will be NO RECITATIONS this week (Thursday, Sep 8). Recitations will start next week (first recitation will be on Thursday, Sep 15).

>Some things to know about what's going on with SPNs/section change requests:

>There is a HUGE demand to get into this course. Until last year, it was only taught in the Spring semester, but starting this year, we are offering it in the fall. So all of you registered for this class are the lucky beneficiaries of this positive development.

>Still, there are literally hundreds of SPN requests in the queue. So, we have stretched the capacity of the class even more to accommodate a greater number of students than ever before - well over 200 in a single lecture!

>We have given out a lot of SPNs numbers in the past few days. Many students have been emailing me about their request. If you didn't get an email with an SPN, that means your name wasn't high enough in the queue. There may be hope still for some students in the queue, IF students who were given SPNs don't need them anymore, or there are students who drop. I will track this through this week and act accordingly. (And seniors will get dibs again if and when spots open up.) You may want to pass on this message to your friends who may be waiting to get in.

>For those of you who have asked for section changes: since this requires a drop and a new SPN, I am NOT going to be able to entertain your request since that would be at the expense of students in the SPN queue who are waiting to get into the class.

>I am looking forward to an engaging semester! See you all in class on Wednesday.

>-- Sesh Venugopal
